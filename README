Setting up the DB
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The db/ folder contains a createDb.sh script that uses the current
  session user to create a mysql database on localhost and load the
  test_data.sql file.

    ./db/createDb.sh FakeStudentData test_data.sql

    The dropDb.sh should remove the database when done.

    You will have to set a db username and password in:
       ./tests/FileProcessorTest.php
       ./source/main.php



Composer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I am using composer for requirements to keep the Unit Tests and
  FileProcessor class available to one another in different locations.


Running Demo of Class
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    You should be able to run the "./go" command to invoke main.php
  from the top-level in the application folder.

    You should be able to run "phpunit" from the top-level in the
  application folder.
